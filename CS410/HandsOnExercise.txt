  -d     Dump the application layer data when displaying packets in verbose or packet logging mode.
   -e     Display/log the link layer packet headers.
 -v     Be  verbose.   Prints  packets out to the console.  There is one big problem with verbose mode: it's slow.  If you
              are doing IDS work with Snort, don't use the '-v' switch, you WILL drop packets.

   -c config-file
              Use the rules located in file config-file.
